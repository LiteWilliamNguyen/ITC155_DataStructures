//ex4. To which complexity class does the following algorithm belong? Consider N to be the length or size of the array or collection passed to 
//the method. explain your reasoning     

//Answer : O(N)
//Explain: This code is used O(N) because the time and size based on the result is affected by the input.
//However, even though result instance is set as double size of the list variable (2*list.length) ---2N, it returns data that is inside of the for loop. 
//the graph will grow linearly, and the constant can be omitted

//ex5. To which complexity class does the following algorithm belong?
	
//Answer : O(N) (or probably O(log N)
//Explain: This code is used O(N) because the result graph will grow linearly. 
//but it could possibly be O(log N) since the size of data will be divided a half in the for loop (list.length /2)

// write a modified version of the selection sort algorithm that selects the largest element each time and moves it to the end of the array, rather
//than selecting the smallest element and moving it to the beginning. Will this algorithm be faster than the standard selection sort?
//what will its complexity class (big-Oh) be?

//Answer : O(N^2), selection sort is used 2 for loop to return the result. 
//its speed will be the same as standard selection sort, which is also O(N^2).
